# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"some song title" (not sure what the title will be yet) by Irviana

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will be making a song using code with sonic pi.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
i will be learning how to integrate the structure of code ive learned and new code to write and play music.
The program im using is mostly used for raspberry pi computers but looking at examples and playing with it myself, it uses many of
the things weve learned in this class including functions, loops(set loops like for loops and continous loops like while loops),
you can write algorithms in order to make interesting effects and beats. I will make sure the song is an appropiate length(at least 3 minutes) and
is structred like any other full length song so the amount of effort i have put in is clear.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

i dont plan to combine with any other class

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
-the song is at least 3 minutes
-contains a defined intro, verse,chorus (instrumental)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

a better outcome would be my song isnt made with just flat notes, there are variations, highs, lows, bass and the ending of the song is smooth, doesn't just cut off.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

the best possible outcome would be it sounds similar to "High risk, High reward" -4by4. Not necessarily in genre or sound because that song is not a full instrumental
but in the sense its actually interesting.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
In order to achieve this i will have to learn the structure of sonic pi most notably how functions and loops work, correct syntax, how the computer interprets music notes, how to code the music notes
and any tools at my disposal to streamline the process. I will need to learn how to debug within the program, and how to undestand my code as its being played but also to be able
to interpret what someone else is doing like if there is an example im looking at. I will also need to review some music theory(and learn some) on my own to know what sounds and notes work best together,
major and minor scales and, when its a good time to increase the amplitude, or reverb. Lastly, at least for now, i will have to make sure i learn how to export
and upload my file so that is usable and readable to anyone with the ability to read midi files as i have never personally used or encountered one before.
