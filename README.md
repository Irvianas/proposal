Hello, 
My final project is called "Oxygen" by Irviana Swittenburge and was made using SonicPi. A program that allows you to make music using code or if you have no coding experience, learn code by making music. 

Using this program was a lot of fun, its easy to get started with playing flat notes 
but it was hard figuring out how to make things work and developing a full song. All in all i think i accomplished a lot of the things i set out to do except my song 
doesnt have a resolution to the end how i would like as i have to just cut it off when it gets to three minutes but i plan to continue to work on it and eventually im sure i will be able to figure out how to do that. 


here is a link to my video with more information and a demo of the song itself :

I hope you enjoy!!
